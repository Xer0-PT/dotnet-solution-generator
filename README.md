# dotnet-solution-generator

A simple python script that takes a few arguments to create a .Net application with clean architecture in consideration.

After an initial code design I asked GPT-3.5 to improve the existing code, which at the end looks like this.

### How to run the script:
- Make sure you have python installed.
- The last two parameters are optional.
```
python3 .\main.py -sln solution-name -proj project-name -infra -pers
```
